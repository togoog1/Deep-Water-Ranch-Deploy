      <h3>COME AND SEE!</h3>
<p>  Travel past the concrete city and over the railroad tracks and come and experience the Presence of Nature! See the beautiful herds of wild deer and pet some of the tame animals.
  Great Blue Herons, Hawks, dove and wild turkeys all call Deep Water Ranch their home. Fish in the three-acre lake or one of our ponds if you like, then settle in by the fire after
  cooking outside and have a good night sleep in your sleeping bags and tents. The crickets are the noise you hear most of the time though you may hear a train whistle but you can
  still hear the crickets at the same time.</p>
